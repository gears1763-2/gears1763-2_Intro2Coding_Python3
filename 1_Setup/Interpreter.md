## 1.1 - Installing a Python Interpreter

--------


## Windows Installation

In order to use Python on Windows, you will probably need to first install a Python 
interpreter. The easiest way to do so is to download an installer from
<https://www.python.org/downloads/>. For this course, the focus is on Python 3, so 
any version 3.X should work fine. However, more recent is better, so this installation 
step-by-step will be for Python 3.12 (the latest version as of the date of this course).

## Linux Installation

For those of you who are using Linux, thank you =P.  

For most popular Linux distributions, Python comes pre-installed (which means you're 
probably already set up!). To test this out, you can invoke

    $  python --version

or

    $  python3 --version

If you get output that looks something like

        Python 3.XX.XX

then you already have a Python interpreter installed. If not, then there should be 
Python packages available for your distribution. Refer to the package manager 
documentation for your chosen distro.
