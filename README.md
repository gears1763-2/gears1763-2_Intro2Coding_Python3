# Intro to Coding (getting started with Python 3)

    github: gears1763-2

This introductory-level course aims to get students started with Python 3, an open
source, high level and general purpose programming language that is one of the most
popular in the world.  

This course will cover getting set up with a Python environment in the OS of your
choice (Windows and Linux will be covered), as well as making using of the Python
package installer pip in order to leverage the sprawling ecosystem of third-party
libraries.  

Once set up, the basics of using Python will be taught by way of example.
In doing so, the student will gain an initial exposure to some of the more commonly
applied elements of the Python Standard Library. Finally, once an initial exposure has
been completed, the student will begin to experiment with writing their own Python
functions. after that, the possibilities are endless!
